# Dawn Marie - Plantation Owner

## Character

- **Role:** Plantation owner and gardener
- **Personality:** Depressed. Wants to believe and dream, but is still grieving everything she lost. Speaks softly, avoids eye contact.
- **Story:** A free-spirited artist who stopped in the port for a week to capture its beauty on canvas before sailing onwards to England. When the port was torn into the rust world, she was trapped and left with nothing. Her hope and optimism have faded. Her dreams of painting for the royal court are now fleeting as she struggles to grow what little she can on this harsh island.

## General Dialogue

**First meeting:**
> "Oh... a visitor. I didn't think anyone new came here anymore. I suppose you're looking to trade? I don't have much, but what I have is honest work."

**Welcome back:**
> "You came back. I wasn't sure you would."

**Name:**
> "Dawn Marie. I used to paint, portraits, landscapes, anything beautiful. Now I grow what I can and try not to think about what I've lost."

**Profession:**
> "I tend the plantation at the edge of town. Flowers, sugar cane, a few olive trees. I sell seeds and cuttings, and I'll buy any paintings you find. They remind me of better days."

**About Tortuga:**
> "I was only supposed to be here for a week. One more painting, then onwards to England. The storm changed that. Sometimes I still wake up expecting to hear my mother's voice calling me for breakfast."

**About her art:**
> "I haven't touched a brush in months. What's the point? Nobody's left to appreciate it. Though... if you find any old paintings out there, bring them to me. I'll pay well. They remind me there was once beauty in the world."

**Goodbye:**
> "Take care out there. The world is harder than it used to be."

## Quest: In Need of Trade Goods

**Prerequisites:** None

### Intro

*Player:* "Is there anything I can do to help?"

> "Morgan is full of dreams despite everything. I remember when I used to believe in hope. I don't have much in the way of skills. But everyone would be willing to trade for salt and sugar if I had enough."

### Accept

*Player:* "I'll bring you salt and sugar."

> "You'd do that? I... thank you. Bring me salt and sugar, as much as you can find. With enough of both I can actually start trading properly."

### Decline

*Player:* "Maybe later."

> *She nods silently and turns back to her flowers.*

### Objectives (parallel - complete in any order)

#### Salt (64 needed)

*Player:* "I have salt for you."
> "Salt. Good. Every bit helps."

*Progress:* "That's {entity.salt} of 64 salt. I need more before I can start trading it."

*Complete:* "That's all the salt I need! I can finally offer something worth trading. Here, take these, I found them while clearing the old storehouse."

**Rewards:** Copper knife and copper cleaver added to shop.

#### Sugar (64 needed)

*Player:* "I brought sugar."
> "Sugar. Sweet of you."

*Progress:* "That's {entity.sugar} of 64 sugar. Keep it coming."

*Complete:* "Enough sugar at last. I can find plenty of uses for it. Found some old tools, they're yours."

**Rewards:** Copper hoe and copper scythe added to shop.

### Status Check

*Player:* "How much salt and sugar do you still need?"
> "I need {entity.salt}/64 salt and {entity.sugar}/64 sugar. Bring what you can."

### Completion (both objectives done)

> "You actually did it. Why? I... I don't understand why you'd help someone like me. But thank you. Maybe Morgan is right, maybe things can get better."

**Rewards:** Rebuilding score +1.

### Post-Quest

> "You've already done more than I could have asked for. The trade goods are flowing now. Thank you."
